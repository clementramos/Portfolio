        `I've been developing full-stack application since I was 16 years old. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then.`,

        `After that, I decided to start learning JavaScript and it was really hard for me in the beginning, but now I'm learning Next.js, Node.js and React Native !`,
        `But now, I'm coding in TypeScript, React, Vue, Node.js, Next.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby on Rails and I'm a beginner in AWS infrastructure. Although I barely have time to learn other languages, I'm loving what I'm doing.`,
